# Silver Rover Arm Firmware

Independent firmware project for a single manipulator joint controller.

Current assumptions:
- MCU family: STM32G4
- Transport: Cyphal over CAN FD
- Control target: one actuator node per joint
- Baseline reference: nearby `bldc_codex` project

Goals of this package:
- keep manipulator firmware buildable on its own
- isolate board support, transport, and motion-control logic
- make it possible to reuse the same firmware architecture across all six joints

Planned module split:
- `App/` application entry point and composition
- `Core/` STM32 platform glue and interrupt handlers
- `config/` board and joint-specific configuration
- `docs/` protocol notes and implementation decisions
- `cmake/` toolchain support

Near-term milestones:
1. Import the minimal STM32G4 build baseline.
2. Extract reusable Cyphal transport adapter.
3. Define joint command and telemetry contract.
4. Port and clean up the motor-control loop.
5. Add board profile support for all manipulator joints.
